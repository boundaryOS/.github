# BoundaryOS
**Building Change-Resilient Applications That Never Break**

We're creating the future where software adapts to change instead of breaking from it. BoundaryOS is an AI-native platform that automatically handles API drift, DOM changes, and credential management—so developers can focus on building, not maintaining.

---

## 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**

Modern applications are incredibly fragile:
- **75% of APIs** don't match their specifications, causing integration failures
- **60% of automation time** is spent fixing broken selectors after UI changes  
- **Credential leaks** happen when secrets are hardcoded or poorly managed
- **Breaking changes** cascade through systems, causing expensive outages

**We believe software should adapt to change, not break from it.**

---

## 🚀 **Our Solution**

BoundaryOS creates an **adaptive boundary** between your application and the external world:

### **🔄 Automatic API Adaptation**
Your code stays the same while APIs evolve. ML models detect changes and generate mappings with 99.2% accuracy.

### **🎯 Self-Healing UI Automation**  
Selectors repair themselves when DOM structures change. 94.7% success rate with computer vision assistance.

### **🔐 Zero-Knowledge Credential Management**
Applications never see raw secrets—only sealed handles. Automatic rotation with tamper-proof audit trails.

### **🗺️ Intelligent Service Mapping**
Real-time topology discovery with failure cascade prediction. Know your blast radius before changes deploy.

## ⚡ **Quick Start**

### **Install BoundaryOS**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.boundary.dev | sh
```

### **Create Your First Adaptive Application**
```bash
# Create new project
boundary new my-app --template=api-gateway

# Start development with hot reload
cd my-app && boundary dev

# Deploy to production
boundary deploy production
```

### **Example: API Client That Never Breaks**
```typescript
import { BoundaryClient } from '@boundary/core';

const client = new BoundaryClient({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/v1',
  contract: './user-api.yaml',
  adaptation: { enabled: true, confidence: 0.8 }
});

// This call adapts automatically when the API changes
const user = await client.get('/users/{id}', { id: 123 });
// Always returns the format you expect, regardless of upstream changes
```

## 🧠 **Core Innovation**

### **Real-Time Signature Verification**
Every API response is cryptographically verified against expected contracts. When changes are detected, ML models generate intelligent mappings between old and new formats.

### **Capability-Based Security** 
Applications run in WebAssembly sandboxes with zero ambient authority. Secrets are sealed with encryption keys that applications never see—only opaque handles.

### **Dynamic Dependency Mapping**
Service topology is continuously discovered from network traffic. Impact analysis predicts cascading failures before they happen.

## 📜 **Philosophy**

**We believe the future belongs to adaptive software.** Instead of building rigid systems that break when the world changes, we're creating intelligent boundaries that learn, adapt, and evolve.

Every API will change. Every UI will be redesigned. Every service will be updated. The question isn't whether change will happen—it's whether your software will survive it.

**BoundaryOS makes software antifragile.** It doesn't just survive change—it gets stronger from it.
